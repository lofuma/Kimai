We would like to thank everybody who have downloaded and tried the beta versions of Kimai so far.
We just cracked the 2000 downloads mark when we take only [MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23590) as a reference.
Please keep testing and please do give us feedback on [our forum]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues). Thanks!
