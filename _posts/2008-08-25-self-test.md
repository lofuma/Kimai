Today I switched over to 0.8 for my real worktime tracking... With little mixed feelings.
I'm using 0.7 since over a year and it never messed up any data.
It's only six days left until release-day and it's really tough to meet the deadline...

*UPDATE: One week of tracking - no problems, no dataloss...*
