Hi Time-Tracker!

Some of you know from forum discussions, that we word hard on releasing the next stable version of Kimai.
But before we can do that, we need at least that Beta version to be tested.

You can fetch the latest beta from Sourceforge:
[kimai.0.9.2.1294.beta.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kimai/files/0.9.x/kimai.0.9.2.1294.beta.zip/download)

Please open our [forum]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues) in another browser-tab during you tests and post any feedback,
so we can improve the stability before releasing the stable version.

The more you test, the faster the stable version is here :)

And finally: Thanks for using Kimai!
