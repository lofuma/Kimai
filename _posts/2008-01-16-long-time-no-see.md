Wow, what a pathetic headline.... A little late - but nonetheless a happy new year to you, folks ;)
Our little break will soon be over and development will continue.
Last year ended very busy and the new one also starts very busy ... and so some bugs are already waiting quite a while to be fixed.
We're sorry about that.

But 'they' force us with money to do unimportant stuff ;)
Hopefully I can bring you better news soon.
Stay tuned!
