As some of you may have noticed we have set up a public bugtracker lately.
So please, if you have any bugs to report use the tracker and place your tickets right there.
On the same trac site you can now browse though our subversion reporitory for always getting the latest cutting edge
version or just for keeping yourself informed about progress.

*UPDATE: We moved in between, this old URL was removed therefor*
