Urs Gerig wrote a little extension to Kimai to export his timesheets as CSV.
Thanks for contributing this often requested feature, Urs!

*"Since I need to present my data in Excel, an export function was nescessary. So here please find my way of solving it.
You may use it for Kimai, if you like. It's meant to run on Windows.
Best, Urs"*

I tested it on the Mac and it works fine. If anyone may check it out on Linux please leave a comment if it works or not.
The script is not secured in any way yet! It's unlikely but still a potential danger for your installment.
So don't leave it in your Kimai directory permanently if you use it.
