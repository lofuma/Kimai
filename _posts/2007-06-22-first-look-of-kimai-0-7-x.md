After countless hours of development work, Kimai is finally at a stage of development that allows us to offer you a first look of our next release.
This version is still under heavy development and is not ready for download or install onto your server.
We have, however, set up a demo that you can experiment with http://kimai-dev.hambug.net/ to give us your feedback.

Please be aware that this release has several ugly bugs, such as problems with Umlauts and cosmetic/operational browser incompatibilities.
Since the demo has to run in virtual user mode, no administration panel is available.
These issues/limitations should not prevent you from experiencing Kimai.
Feel free to send us bug reports and comments - positive or negative ;) here on the blog.
As any previous versions it's best viewed with Firefox.
Opera and Safari are also pretty close to render Kimai properly. No Internet Explorer support yet.
