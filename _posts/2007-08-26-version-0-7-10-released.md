This version corrects a bug that appears when your Kimai installment makes use of the database prefix (which is the case by default).
Normally timesheet records are splitted in two when crossing midnight.
This bug caused Kimai not to do so. So this update is for all of you, who don't have regular 9 to 5 jobs ... ;)
