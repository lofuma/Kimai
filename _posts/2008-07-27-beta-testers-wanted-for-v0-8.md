We're very busy developing the third generation of Kimai which will (hopefully) be released within the next month.
This is a very important release for us because it contains huge changes all over.
Kimai is now entirely extension based - meaning *every* functionality (even the timetracking itself) is a module within its own directory.
We hope this will inspire many developers to contribute to the project.

Furthermore Kimai now makes use of PDO.
Therefore it no longer depends on the usage of MySQL -  any  database type (which can operate via PDO) can be connected.
Because of these and many other changes this version needs heavy testing.
Your help is needed - please contact us if you'd like to participate!

We're looking forward to your replies. ;)
