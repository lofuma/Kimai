Yeah - after almost a year since the last release and a ton of work - here it finally is.

Unfortunately, we had to make some compromises.
A year sounds like a lot of time - but in fact we could have used at least two more month.
Not everything has become the way it was initially planned and we had to cancel some functionality for this initial release of 0.8.
But the main targets, like the splitting of functionalities into extensions or the redesign of the interface and the database connection could be achieved.
We also added some nice usibility features here and there.

Just to be honest - we are proud of the result ;)
And we're wondering if you like it as much as we do.
So get your copies and let us know what you think about it. Have Fun. See you 0.8.1 ... ;)
