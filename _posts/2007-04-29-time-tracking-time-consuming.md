Today I decided to leave the Kimai team.
Working on an open source project takes a lot of time, and right now I just can't find any, even with Kimai running to keep track of that time.
It was an honour to be a part of this beautiful program that does what it's supposed to do in such an elegant way.
And it was a hard decision to take. But right now, my new job needs all my attention.
I wish the Kimai team the best of luck. Keep up the good work!
