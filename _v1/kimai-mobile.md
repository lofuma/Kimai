jQuery mobile time tracking frontend for Kimai, optimized for usage on mobile devices

<a href="https://github.com/kimai/kimai-mobile/zipball/master" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fas fa-download"></i> .zip file</a>

Its a small website that lets you start and stop your time record from mobile devices.

It is built with jQuery Mobile support and works as a developer demonstration
for the Kimai Remote API. For now its has the following features:

* log in
* read projects
* read customers
* read tasks
* start the timer
* stop the timer

Its a very lightweight solution made with only one HTML script, a couple of 
Javascript files and some spicy CSS sugar on top.

Please note, that this is ONLY a experimental release and many features of the 
complete version are missing. We don't have plans to add more features, but we'd like to hear 
your thoughts,feature requests at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/kimai/kimai-mobile/issues) 
and especially [pull requests](https://github.com/kimai/kimai-mobile/pulls) from frontend developers.

## Installation

To install this mobile interface:

- copy all the files into a sub-directory of your Kimai installation (e.g. mobile/)
- point your browser to https://www.example.com/mobile/ 
- log in with your existing Kimai account

## Compatibility

This mobile time tracking solution only works with Kimai revision 1353 and later.
